  "statement": "A steady feed stream containing components A and B enters a flash tank at a flow rate of 120 mol/min. The feed composition is z_A = 0.60 and z_B = 0.40. The mixture partially vaporizes and exits as a vapor stream V and a liquid stream L. The vapor composition is y_A = 0.80 and y_B = 0.20, while the liquid composition is x_A = 0.30 and x_B = 0.70. Assume steady state and no reaction.\n\n(a) Write the overall and component A material balances.\n(b) Solve for V and L.",
