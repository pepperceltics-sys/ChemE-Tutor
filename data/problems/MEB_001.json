  "statement": "A liquid feed containing benzene (B) and toluene (T) enters a flash tank. The feed flow rate is 100 kmol/hr with composition z_B = 0.50 and z_T = 0.50. The flash tank operates at 95 °C and 1 atm. Use Raoult's law and appropriate material balances to determine the vapor and liquid flow rates and phase compositions.",
