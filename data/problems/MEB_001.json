  "title": "Flash Tank Material Balance with Raoult's Law",
  "statement": "A liquid feed containing benzene (B) and toluene (T) enters a flash tank. The feed flow rate is 100 kmol/hr with composition z_B = 0.50 and z_T = 0.50. The flash tank operates at 95\u00b0C and 1 atm. The system reaches vapor\u2013liquid equilibrium and exits as a vapor stream and a liquid stream. The measured vapor composition is y_B = 0.70 and y_T = 0.30. At 95\u00b0C, the saturation pressures are P_B^sat = 1.55 atm and P_T^sat = 0.60 atm. Assume ideal behavior and that Raoult\u2019s law applies. \n\n(a) Perform a degrees of freedom analysis.\n(b) Solve for the vapor flow rate V, liquid flow rate L, and the liquid phase compositions x_B and x_T.\n(c) Verify your results using overall and component material balances.",
