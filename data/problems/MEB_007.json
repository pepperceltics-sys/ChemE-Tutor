  "statement": "A feed stream of 200 mol/min containing components A and B enters a flash tank. The feed composition is z_A = 0.30 and z_B = 0.70. The vapor stream leaving the tank has composition y_A = 0.55 and y_B = 0.45, while the liquid stream has composition x_A = 0.15 and x_B = 0.85. Assume steady-state operation.\n\n(a) Write the overall and component A balances.\n(b) Determine the vapor and liquid flow rates.",
