  "title": "Flash Tank Material Balance (Binary Mixture)",
  "statement": "A flash tank receives a feed of 80 mol/min containing components A and B. The feed composition is z_A = 0.25 and z_B = 0.75. The outlet vapor stream has composition y_A = 0.50 and y_B = 0.50. The liquid stream composition is x_A = 0.10 and x_B = 0.90. Assume steady-state operation and no reaction.\n\n(a) Write the overall and component A balances.\n(b) Determine the vapor and liquid flow rates.",
