  "statement": "A flash drum operates at steady state with a feed of 60 mol/min containing components A and B. The feed composition is z_A = 0.50 and z_B = 0.50. The vapor outlet has composition y_A = 0.75 and y_B = 0.25, and the liquid outlet has composition x_A = 0.35 and x_B = 0.65.\n\n(a) Write the overall and component A balances.\n(b) Solve for the vapor and liquid flow rates.",
