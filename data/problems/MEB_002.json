  "title": "Flash Tank Material Balance (Binary Mixture)",
  "statement": "A well-mixed flash tank receives a steady feed stream of a binary mixture (A and B). The feed flow rate is F = 100 mol/min with overall composition z_A = 0.40 (and z_B = 0.60). Inside the flash tank, the mixture partially vaporizes and exits as two steady streams: a vapor stream V and a liquid stream L. The vapor stream composition is y_A = 0.70 (and y_B = 0.30), and the liquid stream composition is x_A = 0.20 (and x_B = 0.80).\n\nAssume steady state and no reaction.\n\n(a) Write the overall molar balance and the component A balance for the flash tank.\n(b) Solve for the vapor flow rate V and liquid flow rate L.\n(c) Verify that your results satisfy both the overall and component balances.",
