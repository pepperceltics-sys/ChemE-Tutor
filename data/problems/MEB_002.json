  "statement": "A well-mixed flash tank receives a steady feed stream of a binary mixture (A and B). The feed flow rate is F = 100 mol/min with overall composition z_A = 0.40 (and z_B = 0.60). Inside the flash tank, the mixture partially vaporizes and exits as two steady streams: a vapor stream V and a liquid stream L. The vapor stream composition is y_A = 0.70 (and y_B = 0.30), and the liquid stream composition is x_A = 0.20 (and x_B = 0.80).\n\nAssume steady state and no reaction.",
